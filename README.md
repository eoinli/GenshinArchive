# Genshin Archive

原神档案馆是（至少我希望它成为）《原神》文字内容的集合。目前为个人能力所限，短期内不会选择添加其他语言的文字资料。欢迎帮我在原文里找错别字，请通过提出 Issues 的方式向我提交。本网站的页面暂时无法实现响应式设计，所以如需参阅，请把浏览器调整成合适宽度，尽量避免使用移动设备（尤其是手机）阅读，否则可能极大地影响您的阅读体验。

本站尚未完全搭建好，目前只涵盖很少一部分的文本，并且用爱发电，且我是初三学生党，所以可能不会及时更新，也可能无法及时回复 Issues、修复错别字。敬请谅解。

虽然我的目标是收集《原神》内所有的文字内容，其中包括各种剧情、任务、书籍、角色对话故事甚至物品描述，但是显然这是一个巨大的工程。目前的侧重点是游戏内的书籍以及文学、历史性质的短文。

大考将至，为了加紧复习，本项目的开发将放缓甚至暂停，预计今年 6 至 7 月间恢复日常开发。感谢您的支持与理解。

This is (or rather, hopefully it will be) a collection of textual content from _Genshin Impact_. Considering that the Chinese work is huge enough already for me myself to finish, I will not add other languages to the Archive in the short term. I'm open to issues that pick out errors in the texts, so feel free to raise one. The webpages are currently not responsively designed, therefore, please, if you feel like viewing the pages, resize your browser suitably and try not to view the page on mobile devices, especially mobile phones, otherwise you may receive a **very awful** reading experience.

This site is not fully developed and only contains little text from the game. I'm not financially supported and I'm in Grade 9. So I'm not able to always keep up with the game, and may not be able to either review the issues in time or fix the typos. Thanks for your understanding.

I hope to collect ALL of the text in _Genshin Impact_ which includes various lore, quests, books, stories and dialogues from characters and even descriptions of backpack items, but there apparently is huge amount of work left for me to do. At present I want to focus on in-game books and both literary and historical texts.

An examination that is crucial to me is around the corner, considering that I have to be prepared for the exam, the development of this project may subject to a slowdown, or even a halt. It is presumed that the development will return to normal in June or July this year. Thanks for your support and understanding.
